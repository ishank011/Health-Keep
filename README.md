# Health-Keep
A Windows Universal app which notifies the user, through toast notifications, of the diseases spreading in their locality and precautionary measures to be taken, by forming clusters of the reported cases and testing whether the userâ€™s location lies in any of the clusters through various heuristics, using data supplied by doctors and hospitals to report cases (currently used artificial data created for the city of Varanasi).

For clustering, the k-means clustering algorithm has been implemented, and plotted using the Bing Maps API.
